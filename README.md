# AlgebraicExpressionConverter
In this homework of my CS201 class, I implemented a program for manipulating algebraic
expressions of infix, prefix, and postfix forms. My implementation enables the user to convert
an expression of one form to another as well as to evaluate the expression.

I used ADT stack in my implementation, and used C++ as the programming language.
